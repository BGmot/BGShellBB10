Provides you with an ordinary terminal window, i.e. sh running on your BlackBerry BB10 and gives you 
command line OpeSSH suite utilities. These utilities are just ports of what you use on any Linux/BSD 
system so they provide (almost) the same functionality and accept the same parameters.

DISCLAIMER: Utilities perform encryption/decryption that might be illegal in your country, it is your 
responsibility to obey law.
This is an experimental work (QT and BlackBerry BB10 Native development) which brings you an ordinary 
shell terminal window which I was missing a lot being a *nix guy. For now just some basic commands 
are available like ls, echo, uname (try what else you can find). The software is 'work in progress', 
provided 'as is' and any comments are very welcome!

This is a port of QTermWidget(http://qtermwidget.sourceforge.net/) to BB10 OS - many thanks to 
Community for qtermwidget!

List of features:
    -- terminal window with following command line tools: ssh, scp, sftp, ssh-agent, ssh-keygen, ssh-add
    -- soft keyboard for Alt+ and Ctrl+ key sequences
    -- ssh tunnels (work even when the app minimized)
    -- ssh over HTTP Proxy (working when installed in both Work and Personal space)
    -- ssh works when the app is installed in Work space of BlackBerry Balance

- 0.0.0.606
    -- now you can generate any CTRL+ codes just tap on the Ctrl+ soft button and then required code on 
       virtual keyboard. - now this shell can run in background mode (when minimized) - perfect use 
       case for tunneling your SMTP and IMAP traffic securely by means of ssh tunnels. All you need is 
       to create needed tunnels in terminal window like :
       ssh -p 2222 user@host.domain.eg -L 2225:your.mailserver:25 -L 2143:your.mailserver:143 etc etc. 
       Then in BB10 mail account settings use for SMTP 127.0.0.1 port 2225 and 
       for IMAP -127.0.0.1 port 2143. Of course it is possible to tunnel anything 
       you want. Thanks for this great idea to Nick W.
