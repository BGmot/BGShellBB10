This is an experimental work (QT and BlackBerry PlayBook Native development) which brings you an ordinary shell terminal window which I was missing a lot being an *nix guy. For now just some basic commands are available like ls, echo, uname even vi (try what else you can find). The software is 'work and progress' (alfa version), provided 'as is' and any comments are very welcome!
For ssh support please consider buying BG SSH-SCP-SFTP. Have a question? then please e-mail to support@tm-k.com
