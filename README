This is an experimental work (QT port of Konsole and BlackBerry¨ PlayBookª 
Native development) which brings you an ordinary shell terminal window which 
I was missing a lot being an *nix guy. For now just some basic commands are 
available like ls, echo, uname (try what else you can find). The software 
is 'work and progress', provided 'as is' and any comments are very welcome!
BGshell is available for free at BlackBerry AppWorld if you want to try it
on your Playbook without bothering to compile. These sources are meant to be 
imported into QNX¨ Momentics IDE for BlackBerry¨ Native SDK for Tablet OS 
to be built and deployed to Playbook. Qt libraries and libblackberry.so are 
needed for this application to run properly.
